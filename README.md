Financial time series modelling is a research area of great interest since 1970. According to the Efficient Market Hypothesis, market should be unpredictable; nevertheless a lot of work has been done in the attempt to identify patterns in stock movement,  with the goal of modelling non linear and non stationary stock prices. In this report  i  implement  a  temporal  convolutional  network (TCN) and use it to predict ”open” stock prices of Google, having at disposal only historical records as informative prior. A simple long short-term memory (LSTM) model is also implemented in order to compare both performances on unseen data.
